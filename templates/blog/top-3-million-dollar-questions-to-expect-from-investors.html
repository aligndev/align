                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            Entrepreneurs have awareness to spot opportunities, the creativity to innovate, the
                            confidence to take risks and the tenacity to turn concepts into successful businesses.
                            Entrepreneurs represent every field imaginable, and many of their ideas have helped shape
                            industries and the world we live in. If you want to build a successful business and score
                            funding, who better to seek for advice and wisdom than the investors? They have a wealth of
                            experience and know what separates the winners from the losers.

                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            So I decided to have an short interview with Hui Woon Tan to see what investors are looking
                            for in companies and who they invest upon. Mrs. Hui Woon currently runs Alley 51, a venture
                            builder which helps to build startups together with the founders. She’s been living in
                            Vietnam for 8 years and she’s one of the first to invest in the well-known coffee franchise,
                            The Coffee House.
                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            Mrs. Hui Woon believes a market that has problems to solve is a place of great business
                            opportunities, whether it’s problem about health, job opportunity or education. And Vietnam
                            is that kind of potential market.

                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content fw-bold blogDetail-desc__h3">
                            “Everything is a potential if people can actually see the need or problem to be solved. What
                            special about Vietnam is the youthful community with inexhaustible energy which translates
                            into passion and hungriness. People here are young enough to still see the world with ideal
                            and hope.”

                            <span class="fw-bold blogDetail-desc__h3">
                                According to Hui Woon, for each investment, investors look at three main things.
                            </span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content fw-bold blogDetail-desc__h3">
                            People — What is the team and what have you done?

                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            How have your careers progressed to the point where you are now uniquely qualified to build
                            this business together today? Investor wants to know whether it’s a well-balanced team
                            embracing diverse talents and styles, yet sharing the same value and vision for what they
                            want to achieve together.

                            The Royals is one of the best diversity case study. The Royals was named Best Employer —
                            under 100 employees at the 2017 B&T Awards. With around 80 employees who hail from 15
                            different countries and speak 12 different first languages, and with a 50/50 gender split,
                            including in its senior leadership team, it seems The Royals are walking the talk. They also
                            hire people from a range of backgrounds, and count a marine biologist, ex-journalists,
                            lawyers, a criminologist and accountants as staff members.
                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            Dan Beaumont, managing partner, said that “Diversity is important because a lack of it means
                            a lack of relevance.” He also added that the diverse culture has allowed them to think in a
                            diverse way for their clients and be able to do a diverse range of work. If the company’s
                            employees are not diverse enough to reflect their audience, underrepresented communities
                            will continue to be underrepresented or ignored. That’s a huge loss of benefit.
                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content fw-bold blogDetail-desc__h3">
                            Approach — How you approach the problems, the solutions you are doing and the organization
                            you are building up.
                        </div>
                        <div class="blogDetail-desc__content">
                            The right approach can mean a world of difference in business. Part of setting up a
                            long-term plan is knowing where the problem spots are, as well as which business
                            philosophies work better for which industries. That’s why having a strong group of peers and
                            mentors is so important for leaders, an outside perspective, or someone who has already
                            faced a similar misstep, can mean all the difference between struggling and finding success.

                            Purpose aka. the big WHY — Why you are starting the business, what drives you to do it.

                            The greatest thing that not many people consider is the why. Why you’re in the business and
                            why you’re starting up (professionally and personally). Huiv Woon always asks startups: “How
                            big you want your company to be?”. And that will determine how you take the business to the
                            next level as well as what you should put focus on. The why is really important.

                            “If it’s just purely for financial purpose/money, I don’t invest in those kinds of company.”

                            Hui Woon believes what makes a business grow sustainably is their reason of existence. It
                            should be about doing something good serving the people and the community.

                            Doing Good Business by Doing Good is no longer an unusual concept. It not only attracts and
                            convinces investors but employees as well. The millennial generation, which now makes up the
                            largest part of the workforce, is characterized by a desire for purpose. They want their
                            employment to mean something. Sitting in a cubicle for the sake of pure profit and an
                            occasional profit isn’t on their agenda.

                            One of the top startups in 2013, Ranku, a marketplace for online degrees from traditional
                            universities, has incorporated social responsibility at the core of their company.
                            Philanthropic strategies and strong shared values were particularly important when it came
                            to finding investors who would want to work with them. Today, Mark Cuban and Microsoft are
                            some of their largest investors. “I think it [social responsibility] should be a part of
                            every business, even in the smallest way,” said Kim Taylor, co-founder and CEO at Ranku.

                            From that vision, you can sustainably build something that really matters. It is a strategy
                            for the long term health of a company. “Creating something that matters is table stakes for
                            getting your name on the map. Forget news for the sake of news; focus on being recognized
                            for your impact. Consider why your idea is game-changing, then relentlessly build toward
                            your vision.” — Sarah Hodges, partner, Pillar VC.

                            needs a nice packaging. That’s one thing you should never forget. Design is everything.
                            “Design is a visual language to let your consumer know what value you’re gonna deliver to
                            them.” If your company lacks resources in that area you can have professionals to help you
                            with it. Design should be the last but not least step to complete your product.
